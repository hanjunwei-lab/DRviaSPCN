### <font face="微软雅黑"> Introduce </font>
<font face="微软雅黑"> We developed a novel software package (DRviaSPCN) that enables repurposing drugs via a subpathway (SP) crosstalk network. The main process include construction of the SP network and calculation of the centrality scores of SPs to reflect the influence of SP crosstalk, calculating the enrichment score of subpathways and weighting them with corresponding centrality score to get weighted enrichment score(weighted-ES), calculation of enrichment scores of drug- and disease-induced dysfunctional SPs and weighted them by the centrality scores of SPs, evaluation of the drug-disease reverse association at the weighted SP level, identification of cancer candidate drugs. There are also several functions used to visualize the results such as visualization of the subpathway network structure of interest, chemical molecular formula of the drug or compound, and heatmap of the expression of subpathways in different sample types.

This vignette illustrates how to easily use the **DRviaSPCN package**. Here, with the use of functions in this package, users could identify potential therapeutic drugs for disease through estimating drug-disease reverse association.

**The method consists of three parts:**

**1.Evaluating influence of SP crosstalk.** 
 We think two SPs are functionally related if there are some genes in two SPs that share at least more than one common biological function (GO term). To analyze the influence of SP crosstalk, we first construct a weighted SP/GO bipartite network. We defined an edge between a SP and a Go term if they have at least one common gene. For a certain disease, we used the different level of the shared genes between two types of samples (disease and normal), and the Jaccard index between a pair of SP and go term to define the weight of the edge. Next, we constructed a SP-SP network based on the SP-GO network. Similarly, we defined an edge between two subpathways if they have at least a common biology function. After the above steps, a SP-SP network induced by disease could be constructed. Then, we applied random walk algorithm to the SP-SP network to calculate eigenvector centrality score of SPs which can reflect the influence of SP crosstalk. Finally, the statistical significance (p-value) of these centrality scores was assessed using a bootstrap-based randomization method. In the same way, the eigenvector centrality score and p-value of SPs induced by each drug can also be calculated.

**2.Evaluating drug-disease reverse association based on disease- and drug-induced SPs weighted by the SP crosstalk.**
 In this part, CMap build 02 raw data was downloaded from the CMap website (Lamb et al. 2006). After constructing gene expression profiles, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to calculate the enrichment score of SPs For a disease, we applied the GSEA method to the gene expression profile of the disease. After calculating the enrichment score (*ES*) of SPs, we weighted them with corresponding centrality scores to calculate weighted enrichment score (weighted-ES). In the same way, the weighted enrichment score (weighted-ES) of SPs induced by each drug can also be calculated. We defined a drug-disease reverse association score (*RS*) to reflect the treatment extent of a drug at the SP level. For each drug and certain disease, the SPs were ranked in descending order based on the corresponding weighed-ES. We mapped the up-and down-regulated subpathways induced by disease to the ranked list of SPs induced by each drug to calculate the *ks.up* and *ks.down*. And the *RS* is equal to *ks.up - ks.down*.

**3.Identifying statistically significant disease-candidate drugs.**
 Generally, a drug was applied with different instances (different concentrations, cancer cell lines or duration), we thus calculated the RS for each instance of all drugs. After normalization, a ranked instance list was constructed according to the normalized scores of all instances. For a given drug, the instance set of the drug was extracted and mapped to the ranked list, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic was used to compute the drug enrichment score (DES) based on the instance set. If the instance set of the drug enriches at the negative RS region of the list, the DES will be strong negative indicating the drug in different instances may have consistent treatment effect on the disease. To estimate the statistical significance (empirical p-values) of the DES, we randomly selected the same number of instances for the drug to recalculate the DES, and we repeated this process N times. The p-value was then calculated as p-value = M/N, where M is the number of randomly selected DESs less than the observed DES. In the package, the default randomly selected times are set at 1000. To correct for multiple comparisons, we adjusted the empirical p-values of drugs using the false discovery rate (FDR) method
